# Datalus Office Hours Front to Back
Code samples from my work at Datalus, where my team and I built an Education Management System web application. This repository demonstrates the Front, Middle and Back End tiers I wrote to program the Office Hours functionality; this includes work in C#, ASP.NET MVC 5.x, .Net 4.5, WebApi 2.x, T-SQL, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 3.0.
